# SQL_Data_Analysis

We need to perform Data Clean process before analyzing data. 

The data cleaning process contains following steps:

1. Remove Deplicates

2. Standardize the Data, including fix Null Values or Blank Values

3. Remove any columns and rows that unneeded

Once the data is cleaned up, then we can perform data analysis. 

If the dataset is unavailable, then you can process the data cleaning stage before executing data analysis via the link: https://github.com/AlexMaAU/SQL-Data-Clean-Demo
