Data Analysis Findings on Global Layoff Statistics from 2020 to 2023:

- The peak range for both Total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off falls between 2020 and 2022, indicating the significant impact of Covid-19 on the global economy. Among affected countries, the United States experienced the highest number of layoffs, reaching 256,559 individuals, followed by India with 25,993 and the Netherlands with 17,220. However, the economic blow to the United States is substantial, as the combined layoffs in India and the Netherlands only account for 16.8% of those in the United States.

- Among all industries, the sectors most affected by Covid-19 are Consumer, Retail, Transportation, Finance, and Healthcare. These industries experienced the greatest impact due to the economic downturn during Covid-19 and the resulting decrease in purchasing power and investment willingness.

- The top five companies with the highest total layoffs in the dataset are Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and Microsoft. Despite being in the IT industry, these five tech giants also faced severe economic challenges following the global economic downturn post-Covid-19. Moreover, with the influx of investment into the IT industry before Covid-19, these tech giants were aggressively hiring, which likely contributed to the subsequent layoffs.

- Analyzing layoff data by month reveals that the layoff trend started in late 2020, peaked from September 2021 to January 2022, and gradually decreased thereafter. However, considering the sustained layoffs after January 2022, there are reasons to doubt a full economic recovery globally. Many companies and industries are merely maintaining operations, and their profitability has not improved compared to pre-pandemic levels.
